# password-generator

I was given the Task to make a Password Generator with Javascript.

thought the assignment was very difficult I was able to do after hours of work watching videos and studying on the web.

When you click on the button to generate a password you will be presented with a prompt giving certain password criteria. When you select the criteria it will as for you to choose a length of atleast 8-128 characters.
Then you will confirm weather or not you want it to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. Then the input will start to validate one character at a time depending on how long you wanted the password to be. Then the password will generate matching the criteria the user wanted. Then the password will be displayed on the your Password.
